And he had also called for Muslims to be temporarily banned from entering the US over security concerns.</p>\r\n                <p>But, speaking in the Saudi capital to leaders of 55 Muslim-majority countries, Mr Trump called this a \"new chapter\", saying he was not there to \"lecture\" them or impose the American way of life.</p>\r\n                <p>The fight against extremism, he added, was not a battle between different faiths or civilizations: \"This is a battle between good and evil\".</p>\r\n                <p>\"A better future is only possible if your nations drive out the terrorists, and drive out the extremists\".</p>    \r\n                <p>But, he added, the countries could not wait for \"American power\" to act, and had to \"fulfil their part of the burden\".</p>\r\n                <p>He singled out Iran for criticism, accusing it of fuelling sectarian conflict and supporting \"unspeakable crimes\" by the government of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria.</p>\r\n                <p>Responding on Twitter, Iran\'s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif mockingly called Saudi Arabia \"that bastion of democracy and moderation\" and suggested that the US was milking the country for billions of dollars in newly-signed arms deals worth more than $350bn (£270bn).</p>\r\n                <hr>\r\n                <p>Behind the lavish praise heaped on his hosts, President Trump used this speech to deliver a tough message to Arab and Muslim governments: deal with the ideology that fuels terrorism now or live with it for generations to come.</p>\r\n                <p>He went out of his way to avoid the sort of inflammatory language he\'s more usually known for. His repeated condemnation of Saudi Arabia\'s regional rival Iran will have pleased the Gulf Arab leaders listening.</p>\r\n                <p>Unlike his predecessor, Barack Obama, this US president made no mention of human rights or democracy. But he did condemn the oppression of women.</p>\r\n                <p>And amongst several cynical reactions to the speech from around the region on social media, some have pointed out that here in Saudi Arabia women are forbidden to drive and there are no parliamentary elections. In Iran, the country accused by Mr Trump of being behind much of the current terrorism across the Middle East, they have just had a free election and women are free to drive.</p>\r\n                <hr>\r\n                <p>Analysts said the speech was a change for Mr Trump, who is trying to redefine his relationship with the Muslim world after several controversial remarks, including an interview last year in which he famously said: \"I think Islam hates us.\"</p>\r\n                <p>His highly anticipated address did not include the phrase \"radical Islamic terrorism\", which he had used before and is considered offensive by many Muslims. A transcript of the text published on his Facebook page included a mention of \"Islamist extremism\" and \"Islamist terror groups\".</p>\r\n                <p>But in his speech Mr Trump said: \"That means honestly confronting the crisis of Islamic extremism and the Islamists and Islamic terror of all kinds.\" It was not immediately clear if he stumbled over the word or decided to change the script.</p>\r\n                <p>Meanwhile, the US and six Gulf states announced a deal to co-ordinate their efforts aimed at cutting off sources of money for extremist groups, including so-called Islamic State (IS).</p>\r\n                <p>The countries - Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain - are involved in the fight against the militants, but have been accused of backing the group and other Sunni militants - most notably in a 2014 email by Hillary Clinton released by Wikileaks.</p>\r\n                <p>\"The unique piece of it is that every single one of them are signatories on how they\'re responsible and will actually prosecute the financing of terrorism, including individuals,\" said Dina Powell, US Deputy National Security Adviser for Strategy.</p>'),

Microsoft issued a patch, or update, for the vulnerability in its older Windows operating systems in March.</p>\r\n                <p>If all IT departments everywhere had implemented this patch immediately, the WannaCry ransomware worm wouldn\'t have been able to run riot across the globe.</p>\r\n                <p>Although the hackers are thought to have extorted just £60,000 worth of bitcoins, the disruption was significant, with some patients having operations and appointments cancelled and some corporate data being lost for ever.</p>\r\n                <p>David Venable, vice-president of cyber-security at Masergy Communications, an IT services firm, is a former intelligence officer with the US National Security Agency.</p>\r\n                <p>He says: \"There are a lot of practical challenges in deploying patch updates; from having unsupported operating systems [OSs] that don\'t have patches available, through to the practicalities of rolling out sweeping changes across massive networks, potentially globally.</p>\r\n                <p>\"But these aren\'t new challenges - anyone running these networks should have had this solved long before now.</p>\r\n                <p>\"This isn\'t rocket science; it\'s an oil change.\"</p>    \r\n                <p>And Rob Wainwright, director of Europol, believes that the recent failings in cyber defences were more to do with lack of leadership in large organisations than lack of IT investment.</p>\r\n                <p>\"It\'s frustrating frankly, because in the health sector there have been multiple ransomware attacks, in the United States, in Europe, for the last two years, long before WannaCry came along, and so the lessons should have been heeded by now,\" he told the BBC.</p>\r\n                <p>According to the Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report 2017, ransomware accounts for 72% of malware incidents in the healthcare industry.</p>\r\n                <p>Overall, there has been a 50% rise in ransomware incidents reported in the last 12 months.</p>\r\n                <hr>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">Complex systems</p>\r\n                <p>But how easy is it really to keep large, complex computer networks up-to-date and protected?</p>\r\n                <p>Nik Whitfield from security firm Panaseer says that for many large businesses, patching their systems isn\'t a question of turning on \"auto-updates\" then sitting back and relaxing.</p>    \r\n                <p>This is because some software applications specific to their business might rely on certain versions of operating systems (OS). Updating the OS could affect how those programs function.</p>\r\n                <img src=\"http://localhost/articles/images/jumbo21.png\">\r\n                <p>It\'s a point echoed by Adam Meyers, vice-president of cyber-security company CrowdStrike: \"It is important to recognise that patch roll-outs are complex. High-profile patch fiascos have made IT departments wary of automatic patch installations.\"</p>\r\n                <p>Some companies have suffered embarrassing shutdowns of their networks after patch roll-outs, for example.</p>\r\n                <p>Health service providers in the UK and abroad were particularly affected because they were often reliant on old versions of Windows, and also because important medical equipment supplied by third parties - MRI scanners, blood analysis systems and so on - can\'t be easily upgraded or patched.</p>\r\n                <p>\"Primarily this is because the patch may affect the equipment,\" says Simon Edwards, European cyber security architect at Trend Micro, \"but other times the vendor simply refuses to do it.\"</p>\r\n                <p>Older companies that have acquired or merged with other firms over the years, will have built up a ragtag patchwork of legacy systems - sometimes hundreds of programs - all requiring maintenance.</p>\r\n                <p>\"It always comes down to prioritisation,\" says Mr Whitfield. \"There\'s always too much work to do, so they\'re constantly looking at how best to spend that next security dollar.</p>\r\n                <p>\"Patching a business is like trying to mend a moving vehicle that is made from a hundred different vehicles bolted together.\"</p>\r\n                <p>This is why it can sometimes take months before known security vulnerabilities get patched.</p>\r\n                <p>And the brutal truth is that there are plenty of companies and organisations that simply don\'t have enough IT staff or take cyber risk seriously enough, argues Mike DeCesare, chief executive of network security firm, ForeScout.</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">Top priorities</p>                \r\n                <p>As well as keeping antivirus, firewall, application and OS software up-to-date, backing up key data regularly to offline hard drives should be a top priority, most cyber experts agree.</p>\r\n                <p>This is because data breaches and cyber-attacks are inevitable these days.</p>\r\n                <p>The bad news is that the average cost of a data breach globally stands at $4m (£3.1m), according to SailPoint, an identity management firm.</p>\r\n                <p>One common problem is that companies often don\'t know what data they have, where it is, or what data is the most important, says Kirsten Bay, chief executive of network monitoring firm, Cyber Adapt.</p>\r\n                <p>\"Concentrate on protecting the most critical data,\" she says.</p>\r\n                <p>Cyber-security used to be about building an impregnable wall around your company. But now that hackers seem to be finding weak points in these perimeter defences with increasing ease - largely due to the proliferation of wireless devices accessing the network at home and in the office - focus has moved towards defending critical parts within the network.</p>\r\n                <p>\"Once inside an organisation a hacker or malware will get around pretty quickly,\" explains David Venable, \"but if you take the \'zero trust model\' approach and treat every network as hostile, a lot of this could have been prevented.\"</p>\r\n                <p>In practice, this means constantly monitoring your network for unusual behaviour and only giving access to certain data and applications to those who absolutely need it.</p>\r\n                <p>Everyone else is treated as potentially hostile, even if they work for you.</p>\r\n                <p>\"By identifying a suspicious process or behaviour and applying machine learning to let all other computers know about it, organisations can be on the front foot,\" argues CrowdStrike\'s Mr Meyers.</p>\r\n                <p>Trend Micro\'s Simon Edwards warns companies against thinking there\'s a simple one-size-fits-all solution to these cyber-security challenges.</p>\r\n                <p>\"Companies should never rely on one technology or process to stop malware,\" he says. \"They need to use multiple methods which inter-operate with one another to detect and stop attacks.\"</p>\r\n                <p>There is evidence that firms have been rushing out to buy security products in the aftermath of the WannaCry attack.</p>\r\n                <p>Erich Litch, chief revenue officer for software marketplace 2Checkout says: \"In the US, the number of security software purchases is up 43% as organisations look to avoid the large-scale attacks seen in the UK.\"</p>\r\n                <p>In the UK, sales have risen 25%, he says. \"[But] panic buying security software is not the answer. Make cyber-security an active part of your strategy, not a reaction to a disaster.\"</p>\r\n                <p>This takes board-level commitment to cyber-security, most experts agree.</p>'),

Because the foreign fighters are the strategic threat should they return home to Tunis, to Kuala Lumpur, to Paris, to Detroit, wherever. Those foreign fighters are a threat.

They will be drawn from Deir el-Zour, which has come under increasing U.S. aerial bombardment, to the western Iraqi city of al-Qaim.

It’s designed to ensure the arch-rivals face each other in a tournament.', '<p>The draw for a big sporting event is always an occasion much looked forward to. In the case of a major football tournament, managers and fans wait with bated breath for what is in store for their teams. At almost every competition, one of the pools is dubbed the ‘Group of Death’ which features three or more top teams, out of which one or more will have to take the early flight home.</p>\r\n                <p>At tennis Grand Slams, the luck of the draw decides which fancied player has a tougher road to the title, and which journeyman faces a big star in the first round.</p>\r\n                <p>But FIFA World Cup , European Championships and Grand Slams are institutions in themselves regardless of the teams in contention. Also, football and tennis are sports more broad-based globally and not dependent on one or two big names or match-ups for catching eyeballs and sponsors.</p>\r\n                <p>That is certainly not the case with cricket, as the regular India-Pakistan encounters at global ICC events would suggest. For the fifth ICC tournament in succession, from the 2012 World T20 onwards, the two neighbours would clash in the group stage. How does this happen? Is it consciously designed or a happy coincidence for the organisers? Here is how ICC manages to ensure the two countries play each other and get themselves a financial windfall in the process.</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">Does ICC tailor the Champions Trophy groupings to ensure India and Pakistan fall in the same group?</p>\r\n                <p>Yes, they do. Last year in June, when the groups were announced, Dave Richardson, ICC chief executive, didn’t even try to hide it. “No doubt, we want to try and pit India versus Pakistan in our event. It’s hugely important from an ICC point of view. It’s massive around the world and fans have come to expect it as well, and it’s probably no coincidence that the two keep ending up in the same group. It’s fantastic for the tournament because it gives it a massive kick.”</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">How are the groups decided?</p>\r\n                <p>It’s purportedly based on rankings. The groups were formed on the basis of the eight teams’ rankings as on 30 September 2015. India were no. 2 and Pakistan no. 8 then. But the ICC has another by-rule with which they manage to draw the two teams together. The cumulative total of the rankings are equal for both groups.</p>\r\n                <p>So, the Group A which has Australia (ranked no 1), New Zealand (4), England (6) and Bangladesh (7) make it 18 cumulatively. And in Group B, India (2), South Africa (3), Sri Lanka (5), and Pakistan (8) sum up to 18.</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">What does ICC say about how they arrive at the equal figure (of 18 in this case) ?</p>\r\n                <p>In the words of Richardson: “What we try and do is make sure that when you add up rankings of different groups, that they all add up to the same number of point. You can do that in a number of ways. You can go ‘Zig, zag’, you can go like a snake. So long as the pools are balanced, it’s silly to avoid (the fixture) when you can fairly cater for it.”</p>\r\n                <p>So by either zig-zaging or snaking up the ladder, ICC have ensured the money-spinners India and Pakistan are in the same group.</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">What about the venue?</p>\r\n                <p>Here, too, ICC have made the smartest move possible. The Indo-Pak contest would be played in Birmingham, a city teeming with people of Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin. According to the 2011 census, Asian and Asian British people make up 26.6% of the population. And at least one in four people living in Birmingham were born outside UK.</p>\r\n                <p>In the words of Richardson, “as long as the pools are balanced, it’s silly to avoid [the India-Pakistan fixture] when you can fairly cater for it.”</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">What does Virat Kohli have to say about playing Pakistan?</p>\r\n                <p>“With all due respect, it’s about playing the game that we love. Yes, an India-versus-Pakistan match is always exciting. For people watching in the stadium, the game is different. If you ask players from both sides, it is like any other game. We prepare for it like it is any other game. The atmosphere around the ground is different. But in our heads, it’s like playing against any other team. It’s not the first time we are playing against them. There is no need to motivate players any differently. If you are playing for India, there is no need for any separate motivation. Yes, you need to be passionate, but there is no need to get emotional.”</p>'),

According to a report in The Hill, Schulz slammed Trump, \"The chancellor represents all of us at summits like these. And I reject with outrage the way this man takes it upon himself to treat the head of our country\'s government. That is unacceptable.\"</p>\r\n                <p>This was enough for Trump to react it seems. And he expressed his displeasure and anger through a tweet again reminding Germany of the \"massive trade deficit\" that the country has with the US and its \"far less\" NATO contribution than required and added that he was going to change it.</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">TRUMP\'S ANTI-GERMANY TWEETS</p>\r\n                <p>On May 25, Donald Trump had charged Germans for cornering business and jobs in the US. While blasting Germans, Trump had said, \"The Germans are bad, very bad. See the millions of cars they are selling to the US. Terrible. We will stop this.\"</p>\r\n                <p>In response to Trump\'s criticism, Sigmar Gabriel had quipped that the US automakers needed to come up with better cars. He termed products of American automakers \"worse, weaker and more expensive\", an Associated Press report said.</p>\r\n                <p>And during the G7 Summit also, he behaved like he was acting unilaterally. While six G7 members, Germany, France, Italy, Britain, Japan and Canada reiterated their commitment for the 2015 Paris climate deal, Trump remained non-committal saying he needed more time to think over it. Merkel was blunt in her criticism over Trump\'s stand saying the developments say the US will not stay with the climate deal.</p>\r\n                <p>Trump has been a vocal critic of the Paris climate deal and he had promised to cancel it, if he became the US President. And according to a Daily Mail report, Trump has \"made up his mind to withdraw US from Paris climate deal\". The G7 Summit said it would fight against protectionism while protectionism has been a cornerstone of Trump administration.</p>'),

Of the two, only Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has taken advantage of the offer so far.', '<p>President Donald Trump has been handing out his cellphone number to world leaders and urging them to call him directly, an unusual invitation that breaks diplomatic protocol and is raising concerns about the security and secrecy of the U.S. commander in chief\'s communications.</p>\r\n                <p>Trump has urged leaders of Canada and Mexico to reach him on his cellphone, according to former and current U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the practice. Of the two, only Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has taken advantage of the offer so far, the officials said.</p>\r\n                <p>Trump also exchanged numbers with French President Emmanuel Macron when the two spoke immediately following Macron\'s victory earlier this month, according to a French official, who would not comment on whether Macron intended to use the line.</p>\r\n                <p>All the officials demanded anonymity because they were not authorized to reveal the conversations. Neither the White House nor Trudeau\'s office responded to requests for comment.</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">BREACH OF PROTOCOL</p>\r\n                <p>The notion of world leaders calling each other up via cellphone may seem unremarkable in the modern, mobile world. But in the diplomatic arena, where leader-to-leader calls are highly orchestrated affairs, it is another notable breach of protocol for a president who has expressed distrust of official channels. The formalities and discipline of diplomacy have been a rough fit for Trump - who, before taking office, was long easily accessible by cellphone and viewed himself as freewheeling, impulsive dealmaker.</p>\r\n                <p>Presidents generally place calls on one of several secure phone lines, including those in the White House Situation Room, the Oval Office or the presidential limousine. Even if Trump uses his government-issued cellphone, his calls are vulnerable to eavesdropping, particularly from foreign governments, national security experts say.</p>\r\n                <p>\"If you are speaking on an open line, then it\'s an open line, meaning those who have the ability to monitor those conversations are doing so,\" said Derek Chollet, a former Pentagon adviser and National Security Council official now at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.</p>\r\n                <p>A president \"doesn\'t carry with him a secure phone,\" Chollet said. \"If someone is trying to spy on you, then everything you\'re saying, you have to presume that others are listening to it.\"</p>\r\n                <p>The caution is warranted even when dealing with allies. As German Chancellor Angela Merkel\'s learned in 2013, when a dump of American secrets leaked by Edward Snowden revealed the U.S. was monitoring her cellphone, good relations don\'t prevent some spycraft between friends.</p>\r\n                <p>\"If you are Macron or the leader of any country and you get the cellphone number of the president of the United States, it\'s reasonable to assume that they\'d hand it right over to their intel service,\" said Ashley Deeks, a law professor at the University of Virginia who formerly served as the assistant legal adviser for political-military affairs in the U.S. State Department.</p>\r\n                <p>The practice opens Trump up to charges of hypocrisy. Throughout last year\'s presidential campaign, he lambasted Democratic rival Hillary Clinton for using a private email server while she was secretary of state, insisting she should not be given access to classified information because she would leave it vulnerable to foreign foes.</p>\r\n                <p>Presidents\' phone calls with world leaders often involve considerable advance planning. State Department and National Security Council officials typically prepare scripted talking points and background on the leader on the other end of the line. Often an informal transcript of the call is made and circulated among a select group - sometimes a small clutch of aides, sometimes a broader group of foreign policy officials. Those records are preserved and archived.</p>\r\n                <p>The White House did not respond to questions on whether the president is keeping records of any less-formal calls with world leaders.</p>\r\n                <p>Trump\'s White House is already facing scrutiny for apparent efforts to work outside usual diplomatic channels.</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">BACK CHANNEL TALKS DISCREET: WHITE HOUSE</p>\r\n                <p>The administration has been fending off questions about a senior aide\'s attempt to set up a secret back channel of communication with Moscow in the weeks before Trump was took office. White House adviser Jared Kushner, Trump\'s son-in-law, met in December with Russia\'s ambassador to the U.S. and discussed whether a secret line of communication could be used to facilitate sensitive policy discussions about the conflict in Syria, according to a person familiar with the talks. The person demanded anonymity because the person was not authorized to discuss the sensitive conversation by name.</p>\r\n                <p>The White House has said such back channel communications are useful and discreet.</p>\r\n                <p>Trump has struggled more than most recent presidents to keep his conversations with world leaders private. His remarks to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Russian diplomats have all leaked, presumably after notes of the conversations were circulated by national security officials.</p>\r\n                <p>It was unclear whether an impromptu, informal call with a foreign leader would be logged and archived. The Presidential Records Act of 1981, passed in response to the Watergate scandal, requires that the president and his staff preserve all records related to the office. In 2014, the act was amended to include personal emails.</p>\r\n                <p>But the law contains \"blind spots\" - namely, record-keeping for direct cellphone communications, said Jonathan Turley, a professor at George Washington University Law School, who specializes in public interest and national security law.</p>\r\n                <p>Under Barack Obama, the first cellphone-toting president, worries about cyber intrusions - particularly by foreign governments - pulled the president\'s devices deep into the security bubble. Many of the functions on Obama\'s BlackBerry were blocked, and a very small handful of people had his phone number or email address, according to former aides.</p>\r\n                <p>\"Government sometimes looks like a big bureaucracy that has stupid rules, but a lot of these things are in place for very good reasons and they\'ve been around for a while and determine the most effective way to do business in the foreign policy sphere,\" said Deeks. \"Sometimes it takes presidents longer to figure that out.\"</p>'),

Here, in this remote place, they study environmental contaminants.</p>\r\n                <p>It’s a stark reminder that nowhere is immune to pollution’s effects. The island is thousands of kilometres from the nearest industrial centre, yet toxic substances like mercury find their way here via air and water. Contaminants infuse into the food chain and get increasingly concentrated the further up the web you go; so seabirds that feast on fish are particularly vulnerable.</p>\r\n                <img src=\"http://localhost/articles/images/travel2.png\">                \r\n                <p>Birgit Braune, a research scientist with Environment and Climate Change Canada, studies contaminant levels in the birds’ eggs. To get the eggs, you have to collect them from the nests – a tricky manoeuver on the fragmented cliffs of Prince Leopold, where the crumbly sandstone and limestone create countless tiny ledges that are perfect nesting sites.</p>\r\n                <p>“1,000ft cliffs aren’t for the faint of heart,” she said. “We hire expert climbers to go down on ropes.”</p>\r\n                <p>But descending into the midst of thousands of birds takes tact too. “The climbers take their time,” she said, “and move very slowly and carefully so that no rocks get dislodged and fall down into the colony.” They do their best to minimise disruption to the breeding birds. And they take as few eggs as they need to get the information they’re looking for.</p>\r\n                <p>The value of doing research in the same place for decades is that you’re able to see trends over time. Braune explained that mercury levels rose in the birds from 1975 to the mid-2000s. But then they started to level off, coinciding with increased regulations on mercury emissions. “That’s good, but now it’s a question of will it turn to a downward trend?” she said. “That’s what you always hope for.”</p>\r\n                <p>Braune’s findings have played an important role in informing international committees regarding contaminant levels. It’s this information that leads to changes in regulations, like the regulations on DDT in the 1970s that resulted in a drop in DDT levels in seabird eggs. “Regulations work,” she said. “There’s no two ways about it.”</p>\r\n                <img src=\"http://localhost/articles/images/travel2-4.png\">\r\n                <p>Braune stressed how vital the monitoring program is for the Inuit people living in Canada’s north who hunt and fish from these same waters – their breadbasket. “It’s important that this information gets back to the people,” she said, “and gives them an indication of how polluted their grocery store is.”</p>\r\n                <p>“And at the end of the day, pollution is an international problem,” she said, “so the solution has to be international.”</p>\r\n                <p>It’s not just the birds that are affected; the island is a hub of activity. Arctic foxes and Arctic hares have been seen on the island. Collared lemmings appeared for the first time a couple of years ago, but haven’t made the island a permanent home. Even caribou and wolves have been seen. But it’s hard to beat the sight of a white gyrfalcon skimming the tops of the cliffs, or, when the weather co-operates and the waves aren’t too big, the vision of 200 beluga whales, an occasional bowhead whale or even narwals swimming in the waters below.</p>\r\n                <p>The weather on the island makes research here particularly tricky. “It’s predictable, but unfortunately it’s predictably bad!” Gaston said. But there have been noticeable shifts in weather patterns over the years, although it’s hard to tell what that will mean for the island and its winged inhabitants. In the 1970s, bad weather meant fog, but in recent years, they’ve started to see a lot more rain. “It’s really quite striking,” Gaston said, adding, “Have you looked at the recent temperature anomalies in the Arctic - it’s unbelievable!” He was referring to the shockingly warm temperatures reported in much of the Arctic Ocean at the end of 2016 – about 14C above average.</p>\r\n                <p>“I’m not going to be around to see the end of the polar bear, the ivory gull and the gyrfalcon,” he said. “But there may be kids alive today who will – it’s all snowballing so fast now.”</p>\r\n                <img src=\"http://localhost/articles/images/travel2-5.png\">\r\n                <p>Our Zodiac returned to the ship and I scrambled back on board and headed to the stern. The island shrank as we sailed away and the number of birds dwindled until just a few fulmars zipped past the deck. In a few more weeks, the birds will head to their wintering grounds with their next generation in tow. I wondered if I’ll ever get to see this sight again. I’m incredibly fortunate to have seen it once, but I’m craving the view from the top of the island – where only researchers are allowed to go. I want to stand at the edge, looking down at the birds and scanning the waves with the hopes of spotting a beluga.</p>'),

This is the true story of two men’s life-long search.', '<p>According to legend, pirate treasure reportedly worth £100 million is buried on an Indian Ocean island.</p>\r\n                <p>Although the region is thought to be littered with hidden treasure, this one is said to be the Holy Grail, the world’s biggest booty haul. The story, which reads like a Hollywood script, has been passed down through generations on the islands of the Seychelles and La Réunion.</p>\r\n                <img src=\"http://localhost/articles/images/travel4-1.png\">\r\n                <p>Although many have tried – and failed – to locate the bounty, two men have devoted their lives to the quest. Reginald Herbert Cruise-Wilkins, known locally on the Seychelles island of Mahé as the ‘Treasure Man’, hunted the fortune for 27 years until his death in 1977. His son John inherited both the nickname and the quest.</p>\r\n                <p>When I first met John, he immediately barked that I was half an hour late. I didn’t expect a warm welcome; John is constantly hounded by writers and locals who stop him wherever he is, asking if he is looking for buried treasure.</p>\r\n                <p>But as he showed me around what he believes is the treasure site, and talked about the clues and what he had left to do, the gruff man melted into one you couldn’t help but root for. His eyes twinkled and his smile was infectious. Even after all these years of searching, he was still the storybook boy hero armed with his backpack and treasure map, trying to piece together the puzzle. His is a story of hope and of never giving up, despite the odds.</p>\r\n                <p>John explained that the fascinating tale of the treasure started in 1716 when Frenchman Olivier Levasseur, otherwise known as ‘La Buse’ (The Buzzard) because of the speed with which he would attack his enemies, was given a letter of marque to operate as a privateer. But within a few months, Levasseur turned to the more lucrative career of pirating.</p>\r\n                <p>In 1721, Levasseur and his associates – then with 750 pirates over three ships – came across a Portuguese galleon flying British colours, Nossa Senhora do Cabo, in the port of La Réunion, then called Bourbon Island. They landed 250 men on board and killed the crew. Levasseur, who had no idea what was on the ship, was astonished with the haul. According to John, a historian described it as ‘a floating treasure house, believed to consist of gold and silver bars, precious stones, uncut diamonds, guineas, church plate and goblets.’</p>\r\n                <img src=\"http://localhost/articles/images/travel4-2.png\">\r\n                <p>The pirates quickly fled to their headquarters in Madagascar with the British Navy in hot pursuit, and the booty was divided between the crew. “There was a share out; each pirate got 42 diamonds and 5,000 gold guineas a piece. There were extra shares for the officers,” John said.</p>\r\n                <p>Levasseur kept the rest.</p>\r\n                <p>The pirate then disappeared and is believed to have hidden his treasure on the Seychelles island of Mahé.</p>\r\n                <p>“He broke up his crew in groups of 20 men, my father thought. The crew didn’t know where the treasure chamber would be. [The treasure] was placed in a cave, kept for a temporary period, and then when the time came for the proper burial, it was only the burial crew who closed the cavern and they were then executed,” John said. No one except Levasseur now knew its location.</p>\r\n                <p>When Levasseur was finally captured and executed on 7 July 1730 on La Réunion, he apparently knew there were members of his pirate brotherhood in the crowd. He hurled a piece of parchment into the air, shouting \'My treasure for he who can understand’.</p>\r\n                <img src=\"http://localhost/articles/images/travel4.png\">                \r\n                <p>That piece of parchment was a treasure map in the form of a cryptogram of 17 lines.</p>\r\n                <p>“I can just visualise the hands going up, the fight, to meet the paper in the air,” John said wistfully.</p>\r\n                <p>But the cryptogram, which has been tested to be genuine parchment from the 18th-Century by the British Museum, just looks like 17 lines of jumbled symbols to the untrained eye.</p>\r\n                <p>Levasseur was an intellectual, a Greek and Latin scholar who was versed in masonic symbology. Cruise-Wilkins spent years trying to decode the cryptogram, using everything from Greek, Hebrew, astrology, astronomy, mythology and the occult to break the elaborate system of clues. Based on what he uncovered, he believed the bounty was buried according to a complex riddle inspired by the 12 Labours of Hercules, and, after many years identified the treasure to be in the stunningly beautiful area of Bel Ombre on Mahé’s northern coast, surrounded by turquoise sea, lush vegetation and huge smooth granite boulders sculpted by the waves.</p>\r\n                <p>Mahé is a small island where everyone knows each other. They all have an opinion on the story, from the taxi driver who drove me to Bel Ombre, to the lady who runs the guest house where I was staying. As soon as I told them what I was doing, they laughed, and reminisced on the legend they’d known since their childhoods.</p>\r\n                <p>“I don’t care what they think, but a lot of them think I’m crazy. They thought my father was crazy. And the question always with people is ‘Why do you treasure hunt? I mean, people don’t do this anymore’,” John said.</p>\r\n                <img src=\"http://localhost/articles/images/travel4-4.png\">\r\n                <p>But for John, as for his father, the search has become his life, an intellectual and physical undertaking into which he’s poured all his energy and savings. When Cruise-Wilkins died in 1977, John was only 18. He grew up with the treasure hunt and it’s all he’s ever known. He wants to prove his father right, and like his dad, he wants to understand what made the pirate tick.</p>\r\n                <p>“I have found the mental treasure, it is only the physical that now remains,” he told me.</p>\r\n                <p>John has searched more than 40 acres around the Bel Ombre area, exploring crevices and caverns, and uncovering what he thinks are pirate markings on rocks. He’s also found bones, pistols, musket balls and statuettes.</p>\r\n                <p>“I’ve used all sorts of equipment: water pumps, rock drills, jackhammers, hand tools, even excavators and blasting at certain times, [as well as] the latest treasure detection equipment from Germany,” he said.</p>\r\n                <p>Although John is understandably vague on details, not wanting to be trumped in his search, he believes he’s found the actual treasure site, a cavern just off the beach – and mere steps from his home – which is blocked by boulders and can only be accessed by an underwater tunnel. John also warns that, according to his research, there will be a final booby trap over the treasure.</p>\r\n                <p>But it is illegal to dig up government land without a permit, and despite searching continuously since 1988, John was shut down by the government in 2009 until he can pay 250,000 rupees to get a license. He believes that this was done in order to secure the government’s stake on the booty haul.</p>\r\n                <img src=\"http://localhost/articles/images/travel4-5.png\">\r\n                <p>“The government owns the land, so they are entitled to 50%, which is the law,” he said.</p>\r\n                <p>But still, 50% of £100 million is a lot of money, and John is emphatic that he won’t stop searching. Since 2009, he’s been doing preparatory work on the site, repairing rock armouring walls, building footpaths to get equipment in and ‘working on measurements, clues and other data to get this right’.</p>\r\n                <p>“After so many obstacles placed in our way had been overcome, the bond was the final straw. I almost gave up. But I could not give them that satisfaction,” John said. “My plans are to recover the treasure. To get a license. To get that bond removed, or else get the proper funding to finish off the work.”</p>\r\n                <p>Until that happens, the story of John and the pirates will never have a happy ending. And I’m rooting for him to have the last laugh.</p>'),

Before he died in 1899, Marsters divided the 2sqkm atoll into thirds to give each of the three wives and their descendants a share.

The highest point on the entire island is only 6m high – a man-made mound called “Refuge Hill” where the residents cluster during summer cyclones. </p>\r\n                <img src=\"http://localhost/articles/images/travel6-4.png\">\r\n                <p>A beached ship greeted us as we stepped ashore, battered, broken and belly up.</p>\r\n                <p>“Recent wreck?” Rob asked.</p>\r\n                <p>“Maybe four, five years ago,” replied Simon. His speech was slow to make room for a slight stutter.  “Good wood for building.”</p>\r\n                <p>He pointed out William Marsters’ original home through the coconut trees. With a rusting tin roof and half-metre-wide planks harvested from 19th-century boat timbers, the long building looked more like a barn than a home. But it served its purpose as a sturdy shelter: the structure has successfully withstood dozens of cyclones over the past 150 years.</p>\r\n                <img src=\"http://localhost/articles/images/travel6-5.png\">\r\n                <p>Several people greeted us as we walked on to Simon’s house. A teenage girl came over to ask where we were heading next, and was disappointed to hear us say Niue. She was looking for a ride south to visit an aunt in Rarotonga.</p>\r\n                <p>Boats are still the only mode of transportation to and from this atoll. A cargo ship from Rangiroa, the largest city in the Cook Islands, stops by just three times a year to drop off supplies, loading back up with crates full of flash-frozen parrotfish, Palmerston’s only export. Every family has several large freezers filled with this rainbow-coloured, large-scaled reef-grazer.</p>\r\n                <img src=\"http://localhost/articles/images/travel6-6.png\">\r\n                <p>Palmerston residents sometimes hop aboard the cargo ship, squeezing in alongside the chest freezers, to visit neighbouring islands or to catch a flight to New Zealand from Rarotonga or Niue. The only other option for leaving the island is to hitchhike on a passing sailboat. But the window for thumbing a ride is narrow: yachts only travel through this part of the South Pacific from May through September to avoid cyclones and maximize the trade winds.</p>\r\n                <p>At Simon\'s small house we sat down to a lunch of flaky, succulent parrotfish – baked with head, tail and fins still attached – with his niece, grandnephew, brother and 89-year-old mother. I asked if they got sick of eating fish. Simon\'s mother laughed, nodding. She said she preferred to eat “real meat”, referring to the white-tailed tropicbirds that nest throughout the atoll.</p>\r\n                <img src=\"http://localhost/articles/images/travel6-7.png\">\r\n                <p>For dessert, Simon split open two coconuts for Rob and me.</p>\r\n                <p>“Do you play volleyball?” Simon asked. “We play at 4 pm.”</p>\r\n                <p>A lifelong volleyball player, Rob\'s face lit up. “The only thing we like better than volleyball is church,” Simon\'s niece said. The Palmerston natives attend services daily and several times on Sundays, always dressed in their finest.</p>\r\n                <p>We agreed to meet the family at 4 pm, and set off to explore on our own. It took us 20 minutes to circle the island, another 10 to walk across the interior’s main path. We passed the construction site for a new solar power station, which will replace the island\'s unreliable diesel generators with round-the-clock electricity, and stopped at the cemetery, full of Marsters headstones.</p>\r\n                <img src=\"http://localhost/articles/images/travel6-8.png\">\r\n                <p>As we headed toward the volleyball court, A hefty islander wearing bright board shorts waved us over to warm up with the locals. I quickly realized that their volleyball skills far surpassed mine. Across the net from me, Rob held his own. As he adjusted his top after a particularly athletic block, returning a high-five, I noticed that Rob\'s waist was smaller than most of the players\' thighs.</p>\r\n                <p>As the sun dropped to the horizon, families headed home for dinner.</p>\r\n                <p>“Tomorrow, we fish. You will join?” Simon asked as he shuttled us back to our sailboat. </p>\r\n                <p>“Definitely,” Rob replied.</p>\r\n                <img src=\"http://localhost/articles/images/travel6-9.png\">\r\n                <p>We stayed on Palmerston another three days. On the last evening, after volleyball and before dark, Simon sat in our cockpit sipping a cocktail and giving Rob fishing tips. Spear in hand, Rob hopped over the side, determined to finally snag one of Palmerston\'s famous parrotfish. A few minutes later, he surfaced with a blue-green beauty, as long as his arm and fat as a football. Simon nodded in satisfaction, toasting Rob\'s success.</p>\r\n                <p>We feasted that night with our adopted Marsters family, thanking them for their hospitality by sharing fish and more gifts. But without a doubt, Rob and I gained more from that quirky atoll than we could ever give back.</p>');

I listened to the record voice, low and ponderous, as I looked out the small window at the unending desert below. I was travelling with friends to Saudi Arabia’s hidden desert city of Madain Saleh. While many people have heard of Nabatean capital  Petra in Jordan, Madain Saleh, the Nabateans’ second-largest city and a Unesco World Heritage Site, remains relatively unknown. Once a thriving city along the ancient spice route, it played a crucial role in building a trade empire. But today its monumental stone-hewn tombs are some of the last, and best preserved, remains of a lost kingdom.</p>\r\n                <p>From Medina, we drove four hours to the oasis town of Al Ula, and then continued a little ways further to our hotel in Saudi Arabia’s Hejaz province, 1,043km northwest of Riyadh. Our guide Ahmed met us next morning after breakfast. He was tall, lightly bearded and wore a traditional Arabic thobe (robe) and red ghutra (head scarf). Smiling, he told us that he learned his English in New Zealand.</p>\r\n                <p>As we drove roughly 40km north of the hotel towards Madain Saleh, Ahmed told us about the Nabateans, whose wealth and prosperity came from their ability to source and store water in harsh desert environments. They also held a monopoly on desert trade routes as far southwest as Madain Saleh and north to the Mediterranean port of Gaza. They extracted taxes from camel caravans – laden with frankincense, myrrh and spices – that stopped at their garrisoned outposts for water and rest.</p>\r\n                <img src=\"http://localhost/articles/images/travel7-2.png\">\r\n                <p>However, in 106 AD, the Nabatean Empire was annexed by the Romans, and Red Sea routes overtook land trading routes. Nabatean cities were no longer centres of trade, and so began their decline and ultimate abandonment.</p>\r\n                <p>Tucked away in the desert, today Madain Saleh is deserted, silent and stunningly well-preserved. Much of the city still lies under layers of sand.</p>\r\n                <p>What has been uncovered is a vast necropolis of more than 131 immense tombs. At first, their sheer scale and number was overwhelming. But as we looked closer, the Nabateans\' artistry was revealed through carvings of soaring eagles, imposing sphinxes and feathered griffins, not to mention intricate inscriptions. We stopped in front of one tomb, whose inscription translated as being for ‘Hany son of Tansy… and descendants’, and ended with a date and name: ‘April 31AD… carved by Hoor… the sculptor’.</p>\r\n                <img src=\"http://localhost/articles/images/travel7-3.png\">\r\n                <p>Tomb inscriptions provided insight into the names, relationships, occupations, laws and gods of the people who lived here. The Nabateans left no extensive written history, so these texts, unique to Madain Saleh, are extraordinarily valuable. Ahmed explained that the inscriptions were written in Aramaic, an ancient Semitic language and the lingua franca of the Middle East at that time. Aramaic would have been essential knowledge for business and commerce communication, although the Nabateans also used an early form of Arabic – traces of which Ahmed pointed out in the inscriptions.</p>\r\n                <p>Of all the tombs, Qasr al Farid was particularly impressive – principally for its size because the façade was relatively simple. A central door with a decorated pediment was the entry to the interior, where bodies would have been laid in recessed shelves along the walls.</p>\r\n                <p>From Qasr al Farid, the views of the rock-hewn desert presented their own extraordinary drama. Golden sandstone outcrops rose from a flat sandy floor, sculpted into crooked spires and conical structures by centuries of wind and rain. And the silence was overwhelming. Looking out from a tomb interior, it was only our footprints and van tyre marks that disturbed the stillness.</p>\r\n                <img src=\"http://localhost/articles/images/travel7-4.png\">\r\n                <p>Unlike Petra with its tourists, souvenir sellers and donkey rides, there were no other people here. Muslims will not come here because they believe the site was cursed when the Nabatean’s refused to renounce their gods in favour of Islam, and tourist visas for non-Muslims to enter Saudi Arabia are notoriously difficult to obtain. It’s the very absence of foot traffic, as well as Saudi Arabia’s dry desert climate, that’s has kept Madain Saleh so intact. While Petra’s facades are slowly disintegrating, these tombs are stunningly well preserved.</p>\r\n                <p>We wandered the necropolis at will, peering in and out of tombs, touching the cold, age-old stone and losing sense of time. A few hours later we climbed back into our van and headed northeast to Jabal Ithlib, a monumental rocky outcrop believed to have been a religious sanctuary for the worship of the Nabatean god Dushara, Lord of the Mountains.</p>\r\n                <img src=\"http://localhost/articles/images/travel7-5.png\">\r\n                <p>The jagged cliff walls of the siq, a narrow, 40m-long natural passageway that led to Jabal Ithlib, had decorated votive niches to Nabatean gods carved into the rock and petroglyphs of camels and traders. Ahmed pointed to a series of canals that once channelled water into cisterns – examples of the Nabatean ability to manipulate rain run-off and underground aquifers.</p>\r\n                <p>We set out along Jebel Ithlib’s southeastern slope, climbing Mount Ethleb. Dressed as I was in the mandatory head-to-toe black abaya (cloak) this was something of a challenge. My undignified scramble to the summit was well worth it, however. We faced west across a vast plain, and I imagined traders and camels approaching Madain Saleh, their panniers full of frankincense. These resinous nuggets, extracted from the Boswellia sacra tree, are as valuable as they are rare. They would have been destined for the wealthiest Romans, Greeks, Egyptians and Israelites.</p>\r\n                <img src=\"http://localhost/articles/images/travel7.png\">                \r\n                <p>As the sun dipped below the horizon, we drove back towards the outskirts of the ancient city, stopping by a cluster of tombs. We spread brightly patterned carpets on the sand, drank Arabic coffee and passed around traditional date-filled mammoul biscuits. In front of us, Madain Saleh’s sandstone tombs glowed gold with the last remnants of sun. The silence hung around us like a thick blanket as we watched the desert colours slowly fade into darkness. </p>'),

Head to Bekal, Kerala, right now', '2017-05-28', 0, 'Travel', 'travel8.png', 'For an experience of a lifetime, plan a trip to Bekal, Kerala, and become with nature in God\'s Own Country.', '<p>If you\'re planning your maiden trip to south India, then Kerala, with its justabout-right breeze (in early March), humbling palm trees, shockingly polite people (for a Delhiite), spacious roads and scrumptious organic food, makes for the obvious choice. We chose Bekal, a small town in the Kasaragod district on the west coast, known for the giant keyhole-shaped Bekal Fort, the almost-pristine and fairly isolated beaches and serenading backwaters.</p>\r\n                <p>We take the recently-launched evening Jet Airways flight from Delhi to Mangalore. From there it is an hour-and-a-half hour drive to the 25-acre resort, Vivanta by Taj, our home for the next couple of nights. With the tastefully done interiors and architectural style inspired by the Kettuvallam house boats unique to this region, it doesn\'t take us long to fall in love with the resort.</p>\r\n                <img src=\"http://localhost/articles/images/travel8-1.png\">\r\n                <p>The \'Premium Indulgence Villa With Plunge Pool\' - complete with an individual courtyard space, private plunge pools besides a outdoor swing, an inviting outdoor tub and picture perfect view of the pristine backwaters in the morning - is enticing enough to convince any outdoorsy person to abandon his/her activities for the day. We, nevertheless, head out for a plantation walk to the Thonikadavu plantation, about an hour\'s drive away.</p>\r\n                <p>A now-common phenomenon in the district, a proper plantation walk usually comprises a plantation owner opening up his home to visitors for a home-cooked meal, followed by an interactive walk through the property.</p>\r\n                <img src=\"http://localhost/articles/images/travel8-2.png\">\r\n                <p>The meal comprises of tamarind dip, mango pickle, jackfruit curry, banana flower - torah preparation, avial (vegetables and coconut, seasoned with coconut oil and curry leaves), beetroot pachadi (think South Indian version of raita), rasam, olan (a subtle preparation of white gourd, ash-gourd or black-eyed peas, coconut milk and ginger seasoned with coconut oil), buttermilk and red rice. After finishing the meal, we start trekking down, guided by Rathnakararan Thonikadavu, the owner of the said plantation.</p>\r\n                <p>A must for those seeking to get in touch with nature, the four-hour trek through the plantation is nothing less than a how-tosurvive in the wild tour - with our guide always a few steps ahead, crushing leaves and making us play a guessing game.</p>\r\n                <img src=\"http://localhost/articles/images/travel8-3.png\">\r\n                <p>Jointly owned by Thonikadavu\'s father, uncles and siblings, the plantation produces a bulk of rubber, cashew, coconut and beetel annually, most of which is sold. As we traverse down the hill, we get a taste of freshly-plucked papaya, using a beetel leaf as a makeshift plate. The rest of the tree is actually quite resourceful, as Thonikadavu uses a sickle and bamboo to make a cap and bag, which we conveniently use to collect pepper, cashew (which smells exactly like feni), chillies and gooseberries. As we trudge deeper into the forest area, we spot a Malabar squirrel - an Indian squirrel only found in two regions, Bekal and Maharashtra. With a tail as long as our arms - which by then had been adorned with a temporary white tattoo Thonikadavu had made by pressing a leaf on our arms - this particular category of squirrels comes under the umbrella of endangered species. We also stumble across a natural spring, and get a taste of the oh-so-popular fish pedicure, and it\'s just a tad creepier than we expect. </p>\r\n                <p> We believe the walk gets prettier during the monsoon as we come across many dried-up waterfalls. The plantation gets around a group a day during peak season, from June to December, though the strength of the group dwindles in accordance with the temperature.</p>\r\n                <p>They charge `1200 without lunch, and `1800 with lunch, per person. They primarily get youngsters and middle-aged people from Mumbai and Delhi, and foreigners are rare at Bekal, where Thonikadavu started the tourism venture in 2007, though it only picked up on 2011. But the viability of such plantations is questionable due to the expensive labour in the state, which is also making agriculture impossible. \"You sell a coconut for `30 in Delhi, but here the rate is `10-11.</p>\r\n                <p>But, plantation owners have to pay a lot for just the plucking - `1200 per person per day. Add the cost of fertiliser and cleaning to this and it\'s a loss by a wide margin,\" says Thonikadavu. Upon returning to the hotel, we just wanted another massage at their Jiva Ground Spa. The one in Bekal boasts of being one of the biggest in Southeast Asia and focuses on Ayurvedic and other signature treatments for ailments like insomnia and sinusitis.</p>\r\n                <p>An example of their signature couple packages is Abhisheka, which comprises a bathing ritual akin to an offering to the gods, complete with the \'five elixirs\' - sea water, ghee, milk, rose water and oil - along with a one hour massage in a suite. \"It\'s similar to what\'s done in temples. We first use the sea water, which acts like a dehydrating agent due to the salts, followed by the application of ghee, which cools the body, a quality which qualifies ghee as an agent used to cool down burns in Ayurveda. The milk tones the skin, while the rose water acts as a coolant for the eyes and other sense organs. The oil - a blend which has gooseberry, ajwain, Indian Rosewood and brahmi (Bacopa monnieri) - relaxes the body, and is also used after the bath, during the massage,\" says Anoop, who heads the spa.</p>\r\n                <img src=\"http://localhost/articles/images/travel8-4.png\">\r\n                <p>Their Aalepa treatment comprises the application of a mud preparation containing 22 different medicinal ingredients. \"The mud is applied on the body and guest is made to rest on a warm bed, which is how the medicinal value of the ingredients kick in when the herbal essence of the mud touches the skin directly,\" Anoop adds. Feeling like royalty after deepset knots have been neatly kneaded out by Yangchen, my masseuse for the day, all the way from Bhutan, we retire to our rooms, preparing for the long drive ahead, wishing we had more time for the plethora of activities the resort offers. The kayaking on the backwaters the resort overlooks is definitely enticing, though the archery, cycling and bird-watching could also keep anyone hooked.</p>'),

The bed too is distinctive; a well thought out structure that is built for relaxing. It is a sloping wood construction that rises from the wooden floor and merges into the walls. This is great for lying and drinking cups of hot tea as the frequent storms rage outside. The frame around the bed holds books, kettles, chargers and anything else one might want on a holiday. But since they all have their nooks, there is no fear of bumping into them or tipping them over for everything to end up in a muddle in the middle of the white bed sheets. The philosophy of clean lines and efficiency reminds one of the Bauhaus ethic and as if on cue, Stanzin mentions that his friend, a German architect, helped design these cottages.</p>\r\n                <p>The staff here is just as friendly and uncomplaining as one could wish and seem genuinely concerned to make the holiday as easy and stress-free as one could hope for, though this hospitality seems to be a part of Ladakhi nature as all the people you encounter are friendly. In the evening, they light up a bonfire so that the residents can sit out and admire the star filled sky. There are also sets of bamboo chairs outside each cottage, set a slight distance from each other so that one can sit out in the afternoon sun or watch the sunset.</p>\r\n                <p>FROM FARM TO FORK</p>\r\n                <p>The Earth Homes have a farm from which produce is sourced for the simple but delicious meals, the thukpa or noodle soup, a local delicacy being particularly gratifying.</p>\r\n                <p>On arrival, the receptionist assures us that we can let them know if we have any special dietary requirements as they cater for all diets and can make any type of meal - vegetarian, Jain and vegan included.</p>\r\n                <p>From the camp, one can make day trips to the old monasteries in the area. It seems so appropriate that travelling priests built these temple structures in such stern surroundings because the austere mountains themselves are robed in the colours of the monks and nuns and seem to be in calm contemplation.</p>\r\n                <p>There is a statue a few minutes from Hundar known as the Maitreya or the future Buddha, maintained by the Diskit monastery. Under the gaze of this image in bronze and stone, one can take Bactrian camel rides into the desert, to marvel at the present. These animals make the trip around the ever changing dunes with their companions, the men, who earn from them and feed them, walking side by side on the same sandy route. They have made these trips every summer for twenty years, one of the men tells me. The beautiful double humped camels have enchanting names - Marco, Norgay, Norbu. It seems that the world came here for a while and stopped to record its story in the names of these animals before passing on.</p>'),

Even if it\'s not your favorite sweet treat, you can probably agree that the confection conjures thoughts of love, pleasure and reward.', '<p>But in case you need one more reason (or 10) to celebrate chocolate, just look to science. Studies of chocolate lovers -- and even some self-proclaimed \"chocoholics\" -- suggest that it could lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of heart disease, help control blood sugar and slash stress, and on and on.</p>\r\n                <p>Research has even backed up some of the more bizarre health benefits that have been ascribed to cocoa. The Mayans used chocolate powder to relieve the runs, and in the last decade, researchers have identified possible diarrhea-blocking chemicals in chocolate. But as for prescribing cocoa to combat syphilis sores, Victorian-era doctors probably missed the mark.</p>\r\n                <p>\"(Chocolate) is a good antioxidant. It has a good effect on inflammation. We think most of the beneficial effects are because of this,\" said Dr. Owais Khawaja, a cardiology fellow at St. Vincent Mercy Medical Center in Toledo, Ohio. These benefits might include reducing the risk of cancer and dementia, Khawaja said.</p>\r\n                <p>However, not all chocolate is created equal. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory power of chocolate is thought to come from a class of plant nutrients found in cocoa beans called flavonoids. Dark chocolate has more of these than milk chocolate, and white chocolate -- which does not actually contain chocolate -- is not a good source of flavonoids.</p>\r\n                <p>Even a chocolate bar that is 70% cocoa, generally considered dark chocolate, can have varying levels of flavonoid compounds, depending on how it was processed. For example, chocolate that has gone through a chemical step known as dutching, also known as Dutch chocolate, has essentially lost all traces of these compounds.</p>\r\n                <p>Then there is the milk and sugar. \"What we get commercially is not just the pure chocolate. ... I don\'t think the milk and sugar in milk chocolate would be that good for you,\" Khawaja said.</p>\r\n                <p>That could be bad news for those who hope to harness the power of chocolate when they grab a Hershey\'s or Snickers bar.

Studies tend to ask participants about whether they consume chocolate or dark chocolate, but not what kind. To make matters worse, people often forget or misrepresent how much they really eat.</p>\r\n                <p>For now, it is probably safe to say that dark chocolate is good -- or at least, not bad. \"But until we have more data, don\'t eat too much. If you\'re having a serving once or twice a day, fine. But don\'t start having it six times a day,\" Khawaja said.</p>\r\n                <p>Here\'s a look at what doctors, rulers and businesspeople have thought of chocolate through the ages.</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">500 B.C.: \'God food\' for everyone</p>\r\n                <p>The word \"cocoa\" comes from \"kakawa,\" which meant \"God food\" to the Olmec people who lived in what is now Central America between 1500 and 500 B.C. The ancient Mayan people in what is now Mexico apparently agreed. Researchers have detected chemicals from chocolate in Mayan ceramic vessels dating as far back as 600 B.C. Chocolate, which was often consumed as a thick, foamy beverage, probably only increased in popularity over the following centuries. By the time Europeans discovered the Mayans, chocolate was not just for the gods and the rich. Everyone was drinking it.</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">1500: Chocolate is the original energy drink</p>\r\n                <p>The chocolate beverage scored a huge endorsement when Aztec Emperor Montezuma II, who reigned from 1502 to 1520, called it \"the divine drink, which builds up resistance and fights fatigue. A cup of this precious drink (cocoa) permits man to walk for a whole day without food.\"</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">1577: Got the runs? Take some chocolate</p>\r\n                <p>By the 16th century, chocolate was racking up a reputation both in the Americas and in Europe for treating many medical ails, including fever, cough, and stomach and liver problems. In 1577, Spanish explorer Francisco Hernandez wrote about how Mexicans toasted cacao beans and ground them into a medicinal powder that \"contained dysentery.\" Five centuries later, in 2005, researchers found that flavonoid antioxidants in chocolate can block fluid secretion in intestinal cells, at least in the lab, suggesting that cocoa could provide natural diarrheal relief.</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">1719: Chocolate, it\'s what\'s for dinner</p>\r\n                <p>In his book \"The Natural History of Chocolate,\" Frenchman D. De Quelus recounted his 15-year-stay in the Americas and concluded that an ounce of chocolate had \"as much nourishment as a pound of beef.\" Perhaps as evidence to his point, he described a woman who could not chew because of a jaw injury and had to subsist on a diet of chocolate dissolved in hot water with sugar and cinnamon. She was \"more lively and robust than before (her) accident,\" De Quelus wrote.</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">1825: A spoonful of chocolate helps the medicine go down</p>\r\n                <p>A French pharmacist by the name of Jean-Antoine Brutus Menier opened a factory that coated less-palatable pills with chocolate. When his sons took over, they dropped the medicinal side and turned it into Menier Chocolate (which was eventually sold to Nestle).</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">1864: Slather chocolate on your syphilis sores</p>\r\n                <p>Chocolate was the most pleasant of the ingredients in a balm given to syphilis patients that also included corrosive materials. Chocolate was also used as an antidote for infections with parasitic worms. For that prescription, it was mixed with sugar, cinnamon, tree oil and an antifungal agent called calomel.</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">1875: Milk chocolate is born</p>\r\n                <p>After nearly a decade of experimentation, Swiss inventor Daniel Peter unveiled the \"original\" milk chocolate, a combination of cocoa, cocoa butter, condensed milk and sugar. Ads proclaimed the product to be a dietary staple more nutritious than coffee and a luxury that was \"as distinct from ordinary eating chocolate as the Alps are from foot-hills.\" Switzerland had the corner on milk chocolate until Cadbury hit the scene in England in 1904, promising to make \"strong men stronger\" and generally to be the superlative milk chocolate in terms of nutrition, sustenance and refreshment.</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">1900: Hershey brings milk chocolate goodness to American soil</p>\r\n                <p>Milton S. Hershey made a name for himself in the 1880s by developing a caramel candy so tasty, it killed all competition. By the turn of the century, the famous confectioner had moved on to chocolate. After a reconnaissance mission to Switzerland, the birthplace of milk chocolate, Hershey introduced the 5-cent bar from -- where else? -- Pennsylvania. Similar to its European predecessors, the bar was marketed as a daily dietary requirement that was \"more sustaining than meat.\"</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">1989: Antidepressant could cure chocoholics</p>\r\n                <p>Throughout the 1800s and 1900s, texts piled up describing the everything-under-the-sun medicinal purposes of chocolate. But what if you needed medicine to stop yourself from indulging in chocolate? For the first time in medical literature, doctors reported successfully treating two patients with possible chocolate addiction using the then-new antidepressant bupropion, known as Wellbutrin. One of the patients, a middle-aged woman who also suffered from depression, went from eating 2 pounds of chocolate candy a day to having no interest in chocolate after taking bupropion. (She still had a normal appetite for other foods, though.)</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">1996: Is chocoholism really an addiction?</p>\r\n                <p>Research has concluded what most of us already know: Chocolate is the most craved of all foods. The power of chocolate is probably only boosted by the sweetness and creaminess of most chocolate treats. But could it really be addictive in the same way that drugs and alcohol are? Psychologists argue against this possibility. Although chocolate contains caffeine and substances similar to those found in marijuana, it probably does not contain high enough levels to have long-term effects on brain chemistry.</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">1998: Chocolate is the ultimate comfort food</p>\r\n                <p>Forget pizza and French fries; chocolate may be the ultimate of all comfort foods. A study of 330 adults in the United Kingdom suggests that people tend to crave chocolate when they are feeling down, upset or stressed. Experts speculate that this is because eating chocolate, like all enjoyable foods, gives us a rush of endorphins. These are the same feel-good chemicals that our bodies release when we exercise.</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">2002: Is chocolate a cancer-fighting food?</p>\r\n                <p>Is it too good to be true that chocolate fights cancer? Maybe not, according to some emerging data. An antioxidant found in chocolate called catechin was linked with lower rates of lung cancer in a study of elderly Dutch men. A year later, a study of postmenopausal women in the United States found that those who consumed the highest level of catechin had 45% lower risk of rectal cancer, compared with those who consumed the lowest level. However, the authors of the studies pointed out that other foods and drinks, especially tea, apples and pears, are richer sources of catechin than chocolate, and the lower rates of cancer could have more to do with people consuming them.</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">2004: Like giving chocolate to a crying baby</p>\r\n                <p>Pregnant women might want to give in to their chocolate cravings. Women who report eating chocolate every day during their pregnancy go on to describe their babies as being more active and having a better temperament when they are 6 months old. The researchers who conducted the study suggest that chocolate may help mitigate prenatal stress in moms-to-be.</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">2005: Dark chocolate may fend off diabetes</p>\r\n                <p>It\'s hard to imagine that chocolate could keep your blood sugar in check, but dark chocolate might have just that effect. In a small study of healthy adults, those who ate half an ounce of dark chocolate a day for 15 days had better insulin sensitivity, and lower blood pressure to boot, than adults who ate a similar amount of white chocolate.</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">2006: Chocolate is Indians\' secret to a healthy heart</p>\r\n                <p>Researchers from the United States traveled to a remote island in Panama to solve a medical mystery: Why are the Kuna Indians who live there free from high blood pressure and other medical ailments, even though they eat as much salt as Americans? The likely explanation, researchers found, is that this population consumes a lot of cocoa-containing beverages, about 10 times the amount of the less traditional Kuna living in Panama City. Previous research suggested that antioxidants in the cocoa plant called flavanols could cause blood vessels to dilate, reducing blood pressure.</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">2006: This is your brain on chocolate</p>\r\n                <p>If chocolate is a drug, at least it doesn\'t seem to have scary effects on your brain like in those 1980s public service announcements. A 2006 study carried out brain imaging of young women and observed increased blood flow to the brain after the women drank a cocoa beverage high in flavanol antioxidants for five days. Studies over the next several years found that young women had faster reaction times after consuming dark chocolate and that older adults performed better on a memory test after drinking high-flavanol cocoa beverages for three months.</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">2006: Maybe chocolate is not an aphrodisiac after all</p>\r\n                <p>The Aztec Emperor Montezuma II is said to have sipped on the \"divine drink\" of chocolate \"before visiting his wives.\" However, science has not supported a role for chocolate in the bedroom. A study of women in Northern Italy did find that those who reported eating the most chocolate had higher levels of sexual desire and satisfaction. But these women were also younger than the non-chocolate eaters, and researchers concluded that age rather than chocolate consumption probably explained the sexual differences.</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">2008: Chocolate takes a bite out of inflammation</p>\r\n                <p>A study of adults in Italy found that those who ate small to moderate amounts of dark chocolate -- up to 0.3 ounces a day, the equivalent of about one and a half Hershey\'s Kisses -- had lower levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation that has been linked to heart disease. But there was a catch. Those who ate more than one-third of an ounce of chocolate a day did not appear to reap any inflammation-lowering benefit.</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">2010: Chocolate buzz could help chronic fatigue syndrome sufferers</p>\r\n                <p>Montezuma II might have been onto something when he deemed chocolate a remedy for fatigue. A small study found that people with severe chronic fatigue syndrome got relief from their symptoms -- and some were even able to return to work -- after consuming chocolate rich in polyphenol antioxidants for eight weeks.</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">2011: To be addicting or not to be, that is the chocolate question</p>\r\n                <p>Ever lament how chocolate is the perfect food, except when you want to stop eating it? Don\'t worry, science understands. A study implicated both the sugar and the cocoa in chocolate for making adults less able to keep themselves from going back for seconds. Tasting chocolate even triggered feelings of euphoria and well-being in these adults, just as addictive drugs can.</p>\r\n                <p>But even though chocolate may trigger loss of control, it is probably not addictive, said Jennifer Nasser, associate professor of nutrition sciences at Drexel University and lead author of the study. For one thing, it takes too long for chemicals from chocolate to enter our bloodstream, she said. However, other researchers say sugar can be addicting and can change brain chemistry in a way that resembles drug addiction.</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">2012: Chocolate could save your skin</p>\r\n                <p>Chocolate could team up with beverages such as coffee, tea and cola to drive down your risk of skin cancer. A study of more than 120,000 nurses in the United States revealed that women and men who guzzled the highest amount of these beverages and ate the most chocolate had an 18% and 13% lower risk of developing skin cancer, respectively, presumably because of the caffeine they contain. But the caffeine in a serving of chocolate is piddly compared with that in a cup of coffee: 7 milligrams vs. 137 milligrams.</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">2015: Is chocolate good for your heart? Let us count the ways.</p>\r\n                <p>The blood pressure-lowering power of chocolate could be just the beginning. Researchers uncovered other heart benefits in a large analysis of more than 150,000 men and women in the United States, Europe and Australia who reported eating up to 3.5 ounces of chocolate a day. Chocolate consumption was associated with a 21% lower risk of stroke, a 29% lower risk of developing heart disease and a 45% lower risk of dying of heart disease.</p>\r\n                <p>Even better news for some, the study found that consuming milk chocolate, often regarded as less healthy than dark chocolate, was also associated with lower risk of heart disease. The authors speculate that ingredients such as calcium in milk chocolate may contribute to this beneficial effect.</p>\r\n                <p>Although the authors say the benefits they observed could be due to other foods in the participants\' diets, they do at least take the findings to mean that there \"does not appear to be any evidence to say that chocolate should be avoided in those who are concerned about cardiovascular risk.\"</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">2017: Heart flutter study reminds us why chocolate can be complicated</p>\r\n                <p>Investigations into whether chocolate could have any other ties to the heart were taken a step further in May.</p>\r\n                <p>A study published in the journal Heart, part of the BMJ group, suggested that moderate consumption of chocolate might be tied to a lower risk of atrial fibrillation, the most common type of irregular heartbeat.</p>\r\n                <p>Yet the controversial study came with some serious limitations, and it pinpointed only an association, not a casual relationship.</p>\r\n                <p>The study was based on 55,502 adults in Denmark and included self-reported data on how much chocolate each person ate, on average. A serving of chocolate was defined in the study as 1 ounce.</p>\r\n                <p>The adults were separated into five groups: those who consumed less than one serving a month; one to three servings a month; one serving a week; two to six servings a week; and one serving or more a day.</p>\r\n                <p>Compared with those who said that they ate less than one serving a month on average, the rate of atrial fibrillation was lower for all other groups, the researchers found.</p>\r\n                <p>Among women, the strongest inverse association between chocolate and atrial fibrillation was among those who said that they had one serving of chocolate a week, the researchers found. Among men, the strongest was among those who said they had two to six servings a week.</p>\r\n                <p>However, the study found only a correlation between a chocolatey diet and heart flutters, not a cause-and-effect relationship. Because of this, even the researchers noted in the study that there\'s no way to rule out that something other than chocolate could be driving the study findings.</p>\r\n                <p>For instance, there was a smaller percentage of diabetes cases among the study subjects who said they ate more chocolate on average. People with certain chronic conditions, including diabetes, have an increased risk of atrial fibrillation, according to the Mayo Clinic.</p>\r\n                <p>\"The chocolate consumers were healthier as they had less hypertension, less diabetes, and lower blood pressure. The chocolate consumers also had higher levels of education,\" wrote Duke University Medical Center\'s Drs. Jonathan Piccini and Sean Pokorney in an editorial that accompanied the new study.</p>\r\n                <p>\"Moreover, although the study characterized education level, other socioeconomic factors, such as income, were not accounted for,\" they wrote. \"Regardless of the limitations of the Danish chocolate study, the findings are interesting and warrant further consideration.\"</p>'),

That\'s the equivalent of one tree for every 300 cigarettes, or 1.5 cartons.</p>\r\n                <p>This adds to the impact of plantations on forest land, which the study describes as a significant cause for concern, citing \"evidence of substantial, and largely irreversible, losses of trees and other plant species cause by tobacco farming.\"</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">Deadly gases</p>\r\n                <p>In 2012, 967 million daily smokers consumed approximately 6.25 trillion cigarettes worldwide, the WHO estimates.</p>\r\n                <p>\"That means about 6,000 metric tonnes of formaldehyde and 47,000 metric tonnes of nicotine are released into the environment,\" Peruga said.</p>\r\n                <p>Tobacco smoke contains about 4,000 chemicals, at least 250 of which are known to be harmful. It also contains climate-warming carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides. \"The combination of greenhouse gases from combustion is equivalent to about 1.5 million vehicles driven annually,\" Peruga said.</p>\r\n                <p>Secondhand smoke is particularly deadly: It contains twice as much nicotine and 147 times more ammonia than so-called mainstream smoke, leading to close to 1 million deaths annually, 28% of them children.</p>\r\n                <p>Some of these pollutants remain in the environment (and our homes) as \"third-hand smoke,\" accumulating in dust and surfaces indoors, and in landfills.

For the perfectly good, non-bee spellers among us, it might mean they enjoyed reading from an early age.</p>\r\n                <p>But research published in 2016 in the journal Brain suggests it has something to do with how some people\'s brains retrieve words -- or don\'t -- and how we manage to get them out -- or not.</p>\r\n                <p>For as easy as the teens on stage make it look to spell \"scherenschnitte\" and \"nunatak,\" there\'s a lot happening inside to produce each word.</p>\r\n                <p>Start with something a little simpler: \"If I tell you a word like \'yacht\' and ask you to spell it, maybe you can do it,\" said Brenda Rapp, a cognitive science professor at Johns Hopkins University and lead author of the Brain study.</p>\r\n                <p>If you heard the word and came up with y-a-c-h-t, it probably emerged from the areas of the brain that hold orthographic long-term memory, where spelling knowledge is stored.</p>\r\n                <p>If you\'re not familiar with the term of Dutch origin meaning a recreational watercraft, maybe you\'d come up with something like y-o-t or y-a-h-t. You\'d probably miss the \"ch,\" but perhaps you\'d identify a reasonable spelling that converts the sounds to letters, Rapp said. That process takes place in yet another part of the brain.</p>\r\n                <p>In either case, you had to hold those letters in mind, convert them into names or shapes and produce them in the right order. That, Rapp said, is orthographic working memory.</p>\r\n                <p>Each component plays a part in spelling a word, and each happens in a different part of the brain\'s left hemisphere.</p>\r\n                <p>Rapp and her colleagues studied 33 people who had trouble spelling after strokes. They struggled with long-term memory, working memory or both. The types of spelling errors they produced often depended on where their brains were damaged.</p>\r\n                <p>So what does that mean for those who just can\'t spell? People who haven\'t experienced a stroke or been diagnosed with something like dyslexia, which is closely related to dysgraphia, a word for poor spelling?</p>\r\n                <p>\"To be a really good speller, all of these things need to be working well, and they need to be working well together,\" Rapp said. \"You can imagine that in someone who is a poor speller, it suggests either one or more of these systems haven\'t fully developed, or they aren\'t interacting properly.\"</p>\r\n                <p>Human brains aren\'t specifically designed to do spelling or reading, like they are walking or speaking, Rapp said. Spelling and reading only stretch as far back as written language, several thousand years.</p>\r\n                <p>\"They have to be learned,\" Rapp said. \"They\'re not built in.\"</p>\r\n                <p>Most of us were trained in spelling and reading in school, but some will still see their emails marred by the angry red spellcheck lines. What you most often hear people complain about, Rapp said, is that they just can\'t see the word.</p>\r\n                <p>\"For really poor spellers that otherwise seem like normal people of normal intelligence, it could be that ... for some reasons we don\'t understand, even though they had the same experience, they weren\'t able to create these long-term memory representations,\" she said.</p>\r\n                <p>That doesn\'t mean there\'s no hope of getting better or finding ways to cope.</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">Can you spell i-m-p-r-o-v-e-m-e-n-t?</p>\r\n                <p>More research is needed to zero in on which techniques works best to teach and learn spelling, but studying followed by testing has helped all of Rapp\'s stroke patients improve. Repetition -- \"lots and lots of repetition\" -- is key, she said.</p>\r\n                <p>\"They study the word, then try to spell the word. They study the word, then try to spell the word. Study, spell, study, spell,\" Rapp said. \"It\'s very important to test yourself.\"</p>\r\n                <p>For the youngest spellers, the key is getting the right words at the right time, said said J. Richard Gentry, an eduction consultant and author of \"Raising Confident Readers.\" They\'re just learning to connect shapes with sounds and to store those patterns in their long-term memories. Some will still struggle, but a foundation that exposes children to bats, cats, hats and rats, for example, helps them move on to more complex sound and letter combinations, he said.</p>\r\n                <p>Spelling training has gotten more precise as research has improved, he said. No longer should students be presented with a jumble of words taken out of context. But neither does he believe that students should be tested on zingers used mostly in the course of a single reading or writing lesson.</p>\r\n                <p>\"It\'s great that we\'re doing more writing, but spelling needs its own time, about 15 minutes a day,\" he said. \"It\'s all about frequency and patterns.\"</p>\r\n                <p>And for adults who aren\'t aiming for spelling bee success? They can develop \"spelling consciousness,\" Gentry said. That\'s what he calls an awareness that you should take the time to spell check an email or ask someone to read your memo before you send it.</p>\r\n                <p>\"It\'s not their fault,\" Gentry said, especially if they have some form of dyslexia or were never really taught to do more than memorize the words on the test.</p>\r\n                <p>Even Mishra, the spelling bee champ, who recently graduated from Columbia University, said memorization can\'t be the only path to good spelling.</p>\r\n                <p>\"I don\'t think it\'s possible to rote memorize the dictionary,\" he said.</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">The markers of spelling success</p>\r\n                <p>Mishra has attended the National Spelling Bee since his win, and he still sees four qualities among the best-of-the-best spellers.</p>\r\n                <p>They\'re self-motivated and a little competitive. It\'s not about humbling the judges or besting other competitors, he said. The enemy is the dictionary, and the butterflies in their stomachs.</p>\r\n                <p>Second, they usually have a coach. It\'s an English teacher or a parent who helps them along the way, drilling them on words and keeping them on schedule. For Mishra, it was his sister, Shruti, who is now in medical school. When he hit a rough patch and struggled with the same words, she reminded him to run around outside or play video games.</p>\r\n                <p>\"You can get frustrated, tired, exhausted,\" he said. \"I needed someone to tell me: This is just a spelling bee.\"</p>\r\n                <p>Of course, it comes down to the work. The competitors are all intellectually curious, Mishra said. Great spellers are often avid readers, and they commit a lot of words to memory, but they\'ll also study prefixes, suffixes, foreign languages and definitions that will help them deduce how a word is spelled.</p>\r\n                <p>Just this week, after reading in Mishra\'s spelling bee bio that he\'s growing a beard, someone mentioned it was a \"pogonotrophic fun fact.\" Mishra didn\'t know the word, but he knew that \"pogo-\" or \"pogon-\" referred to a beard and \"-trophy\" meant growing or development.</p>\r\n                <p>\"It\'s pattern-building,\" he said. \"A lot of really good spellers are really good at patterns.\"</p>\r\n                <p>Finally, Mishra said, great spellers persevere. Many competitors come back to the National Spelling Bee again and again until they\'ve aged out of the competition. They inevitably leave off a letter or buckle after an intense round, but they don\'t give up and find something else to fill their time. \"Grit\" is what parents and educators call that quality nowadays.</p>\r\n                <p>Mishra doesn\'t expect everyone to see spelling as an art. But he still feels pangs of sadness when friends admit they\'ve given up on trying.</p>\r\n                <p>\"There are going to be times in your life when you\'re not going to have a computer or you\'re not going to be able open your phone,\" Mishra said. \"You\'re going to bite your lip and say, \'I should have paid more attention.\' \"</p>'),

Don\'t skip breakfast</p>\r\n                <p>Skipping breakfast won\'t help you lose weight. You could miss out on essential nutrients and you may end up snacking more throughout the day because you feel hungry.</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">2. Eat regular meals</p>\r\n                <p>Eating at regular times during the day helps burn calories at a faster rate. It also reduces the temptation to snack on foods high in fat and sugar.</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">3. Eat plenty of fruit and veg</p>\r\n                <p>Fruit and veg are low in calories and fat, and high in fibre – three essential ingredients for successful weight loss. They also contain plenty of vitamins and minerals.</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">4. Get more active</p>\r\n                <p>Being active is key to losing weight and keeping it off. As well as providing numerous health benefits, exercise can help burn off the excess calories you can\'t cut through diet alone.</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">5. Drink plenty of water</p>\r\n                <p>People sometimes confuse thirst with hunger. You can end up consuming extra calories when a glass of water is really what you need. </p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">6. Eat high-fibre foods</p>\r\n                <p>Foods containing lots of fibre can help keep you to feel full, which is perfect for losing weight. Fibre is only found in food from plants, such as fruit and veg, oats, wholegrain bread, brown rice and pasta, and beans, peas and lentils.</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">7. Read food labels</p>\r\n                <p>Knowing how to read food labels can help you choose healthier options. Use the calorie information to work out how a particular food fits into your daily calorie allowance on the weight loss plan.</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">8. Use a smaller plate</p>\r\n                <p>Using smaller plates can help you eat smaller portions. By using smaller plates and bowls, you may be able to gradually get used to eating smaller portions without going hungry. It takes about 20 minutes for the stomach to tell the brain it\'s full, so eat slowly and stop eating before you feel full.</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">9. Don\'t ban foods</p>\r\n                <p>Don\'t ban any foods from your weight loss plan, especially the ones you like. Banning foods will only make you crave them more. There\'s no reason you can\'t enjoy the occasional treat as long as you stay within your daily calorie allowance.</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">10. Don\'t stock junk food</p>\r\n                <p>To avoid temptation, try to not stock junk food – such as chocolate, biscuits, crisps and sweet fizzy drinks – at home. Instead, opt for healthy snacks, such as fruit, unsalted rice cakes, oat cakes, unsalted or unsweetened popcorn, and fruit juice.</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">11. Cut down on alcohol</p>\r\n                <p>A standard glass of wine can contain as many calories as a piece of chocolate. Over time, drinking too much can easily contribute to weight gain.</p>\r\n                <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">12. Plan your meals</p>\r\n                <p>Try to plan your breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks for the week, making sure you stick to your calorie allowance. You may find it helpful to make a weekly shopping list.</p>');
